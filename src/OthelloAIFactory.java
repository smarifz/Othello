//
// The OthelloAIFactory's job is to create new objects of your OthelloAI class.
// The reason this class is necessary is that my GUI won't know the name of
// your class, since each of you will name your class differently.  So, the
// GUI will call OthelloAIFactory.createOthelloAI() to create the object, and
// you'll supply the code (which will likely only be one line) to create it.


public class OthelloAIFactory
{
	public OthelloAI createOthelloAI()
	{
		// Replace the line of code below with a line of code that creates
		// and returns an object of your OthelloAI class.  It's likely that
		// your line of code will be as simple as the example below, though
		// you naturally should use the name of your OthelloAI class (including
		// your student ID#), and call whatever constructor is appropriate.
		//
		return new OthelloAI78982550();

	}
